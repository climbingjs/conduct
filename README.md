# The Climbing.js Code of conduct

Adapted from the [JSConf code of conduct](http://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html)

All attendees at any Climbing.js event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event.

# The quick version

Climbing.js is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the event organisers.

# The less quick version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of activities, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organiser immediately. Organisers will be identified at the beginning of an event.

Organisers will be happy to help participants contact police, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all climbing events and related social activities.
